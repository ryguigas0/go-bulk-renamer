# What is this?
This is a simple bulk renamer made with golang

# How does it work?
The user writes in their cmd which folder the files to be renamed are, which part of the file name is to be renamed and what is going to be renamed to. For an example:

- $ ./gorenamer folder test tesla
- will replace all "test" from every file that has it with "tesla"

# Also...
Includes the visual studio code debbuger setup and a file within a folder to test on
